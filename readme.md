# CanJS Exercise Solution #2

This demo is derived from [a previous exercise](https://github.com/zedd45/canjs_commander_exercise/) based on a prototype at http://cancommand.herokuapp.com/. This solution stems from the solution to that exercise as written by [Alexis Abril](https://github.com/alexisabril).

This exercise extends from the previous solution, but is intended to teach us how to utilize / extend [can.Models](http://canjs.com/docs/can.Model.html) so it's usable with a different data source (non-`xhr`; in this case, reading from browser cookies).
